# DefElement
This repo contains code to generate the website
[DefElement: an encylopedia of finite element definitions](https://defelement.com).

The examples included in DefElement are generated using [Symfem](https://github.com/mscroggs/symfem).

## Building the website
Before building the website, you must install the required Python dependencies:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

The html files for the website can be built by running:

```bash
python build.py
```

A version of the website where only some elements are plotted can be built by using the
`--test` input arg. For example, the following can be run to build the website with only
plots for Lagrange and Raviart-Thomas (`lagrange` and `raviart-thomas` are
the filenames of the `.def` files in the `elements` folder that define these
elements):

```bash
python build.py --test lagrange,raviart-thomas
```
