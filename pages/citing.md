## Citing DefElement

The code used to generate this website is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/DefElement/DefElement)
under an [MIT license](https://github.com/DefElement/DefElement/blob/main/LICENSE.txt).

On each of the element definition pages, you can find citations for the paper(s) that introduced
that element. These papers should be cited when using a given element. If you wish to cite this
website, you can use the following BibTeX:

```
@misc{defelement,
       AUTHOR = {{{list contributors|bibtex}}},
        TITLE = {{DefElement}: an encyclopedia of finite element definitions},
         YEAR = {{{{date:Y}}}},
 HOWPUBLISHED = {\url{https://defelement.org}},
         NOTE = {[Online; accessed {{date:D-M-Y}}]}
}
```

This will create a reference along the lines of:

<ul class='citations'>
<li>{{list contributors|citation}}. <i>DefElement: an encyclopedia of finite element definitions</i>, {{date:Y}}, <a href='https://defelement.org'>https://defelement.org</a> [Online; accessed: {{date:D-M-Y}}].</li>
