On each of the element definition pages, you can find citations for the paper(s) that introduced
that element. These papers should be cited when using a given element. If you wish to cite this
website, you can use the following BibTeX:

```
@misc{defelement,
       AUTHOR = {{The DefElement contributors}},
        TITLE = {{D}ef{E}lement: an encyclopedia of finite element definitions},
         YEAR = {{{{date:Y}}}},
 HOWPUBLISHED = {\url{https://defelement.com}},
         NOTE = {[Online; accessed {{date:D-M-Y}}]}
}
```

This will create a reference along the lines of:

<ul class='citations'>
