# Style guide
All the content on DefElement aims to conform to this style guide. This keeps it clear and consistent.

We use standard British spelling in the content on DefElement.

In general, we follow the [<em>Chalkdust</em> style guide](https://chalkdustmagazine.com/style-guide/)
(which follows the [<em>Guardian</em> style guide](https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-observer-style-guide-a)
with some additional guidance, mostly related to the style of equations). The remainder of this
page lists style guidance not covered in the <em>Chalkdust</em> style guide.

### DefElement
This website is called DefElement, with a capital D and capital E, with no space between Def and Element.
More detail on referring the site itself can be found on the [branding page](branding.md).

### Notation
The notation used on DefElement can be found [in this list](ciarlet.md#Notation).

### Reference cell
The cell \({{symbols.reference}}\) on which an element is defined should always be referred to as the reference
**cell** and never the reference **element** to avoid confusion with the finite element.

### References
References to papers, books, etc should follow the following style guidance:

* Author names should include the full first name, middle initial(s) followed by full stop(s), then
  surname. In .def files, they are written as Surname, First Name Initials (eg
  "Scroggs, Matthew W.")
* Paper titles should use sentence case (like this)
* Journal and Book Names Should Use Title Case (Like This)

### Sobolev spaces
When written in text, the spaces H(div) and H(curl) should be written as text, and not in math-mode.
