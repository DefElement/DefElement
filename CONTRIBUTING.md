## Submitting a pull request
If you want to directly submit changes to DefElement, you can do this by forking the DefElement repo, then submitting a pull request.
If you want to contribute, but are unsure where to start, have a look at the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/mscroggs/defelement.com/labels/good%20first%20issue) for issues labelled "good first issue".

On opening a pull request, unit tests and flake8 style checks will run. You can click on these in the pull request
to see where (if anywhere) there are errors in your changes.

## Code of conduct
We expect all our contributors to follow [the Contributor Covenant](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Any unacceptable
behaviour can be reported to Matthew (defelement@mscroggs.co.uk).
